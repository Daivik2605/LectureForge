  "narration": "Now that we've covered the basics of creating a professional online presence, let's talk about how to prepare a great CV. A Curriculum Vitae, or CV for short, is a document that summarizes your education, work experience, and skills in a clear and concise manner.\n\nWhen it comes to writing a CV, there are several key things to keep in mind. First, make sure you tailor it to the job you're applying for. Use language from the job description and highlight how your skills and experiences match up. Don't just send out the same generic CV to every job posting - that's not going to impress anyone.\n\nNext, use a clear and easy-to-read format. Avoid cluttering your CV with too much information or using fonts that are hard to read. Use bullet points and white space to make it easy for the reader to scan through your qualifications.\n\nNow, let's talk about what you should include in your CV. Start with your contact information - name, email address, phone number, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable). Then, move on to your education and work experience. Be specific about your achievements and responsibilities, rather than just listing job titles.\n\nFinally, highlight any relevant skills or certifications you have. This could include language proficiency, software skills, or industry-specific training. Remember, the goal of a CV is to showcase your strengths and qualifications for a particular job, so make sure you're highlighting the right things.",

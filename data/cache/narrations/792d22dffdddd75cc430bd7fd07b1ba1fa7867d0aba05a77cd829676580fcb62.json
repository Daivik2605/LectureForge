  "narration": "When it comes to creating a resume or curriculum vitae, it's essential to keep the format simple and straightforward. You know why? Because many employers actually scan resumes on their computers, rather than printing them out. So, if your resume is cluttered with too many sections, tabs, or complicated formatting, it may get lost in translation.\n\nThink about it like this: when you send an email to a friend, you want the message to be clear and easy to read, right? It's the same thing with a resume. You want to make sure that the employer can quickly scan your qualifications and experience without getting bogged down by complicated formatting.\n\nAnother important tip is to use spell check! This may seem obvious, but it's surprising how many people misspell words or have grammatical errors on their resumes. It's a small mistake that can make a big impression - not in a good way!\n\nSo, let's summarize: keep your resume format simple and easy to read, and don't forget to use spell check to catch any mistakes. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a strong and effective resume that will help you stand out from the crowd.",

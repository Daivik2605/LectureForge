  "narration": "Let's talk about referees. When you're applying for a job, it's essential to choose your referees carefully because their references will be checked. You want to make sure that the people you select are familiar with you and can speak positively about your skills and qualifications.\n\nTypically, you'll need one academic referee, such as a lecturer or tutor who knows you from university or college. And then you'll also need a personal referee, someone who's not related to you but has seen your work or character firsthand, like an employer or supervisor.\n\nWhen providing their contact information, make sure it's up-to-date and accurate. It's also crucial to get permission from them before listing their details on your CV. You should give them a brief overview of the job you're applying for and explain why you're a good fit. This will help them understand what they can say about you.\n\nRemember, family members are not suitable referees. And once you've secured a job, don't forget to follow up with your referee and let them know that you got the position!",
